    <p id="p">Women around the world are denied access to education because they are women. Access to education is a universal right, but throughout history, women have been denied the option to education, which has negatively affected their lives. Studies have shown that when women have higher literacy and education rates, they tend to make more informed decisions about pregnancy and childcare. Higher literacy rates for women is also linked to the development of a country and their increasing GDP. Women's education is vital and benefits women and the planet. Join the fight today! </p>
